	Chemical weaponry has been around since the American Civil War when Union generals considered using artillery to blanket Confederate soldiers in toxic gas. However, chemical warfare was only first initiated on a large scale during World War I and has remained a threat to the national security of all nations since then. Treaties have traditionally lagged behind the threat of chemical weapons, with the first treaty banning their use only being signed in 1925. Since then, Chemical weapons have continued to advance, evolving to be odorless and to kill with extremely small doses. However, due to the geopolitical climate surrounding World War II and the Cold War, few steps were taken to prevent their use until 1997, when the Chemical Weapons Convention put into force a treaty banning production and enabling for the destruction of Chemical Weapon stockpiles. However, some nations, such as Israel, are suspected to have undeclared stockpiles and production capability. As such, some in the international community are calling for more invasive security measures to ensure that no nation is producing chemical weaponry.

Mills, James E. "Chemical Warfare." Foreign Affairs 10.3 (1932): 444-52. JSTOR. Web. 	4 Nov. 2014. <http://www.jstor.org/stable/20030448>.

James E. Mills received a Masters in Science from the University of Sydney in 1928 and a PhD in Philosophy in 1932. He served as a lecturer on chemistry for the University of Sydney from 1933 to his death in 1943. In Mills’ article, “Chemical Warfare,” Mills discusses the possibility of a treaty banning chemical weaponry. In it he asserts that a treaty banning their use and production would likely not succeed and that a more effective treaty would only bind signatories to “not… use beyond the limits of their own territory gasses or other chemical agents capable of producing fatalities...” (452). Mills asserts that any treaty that would limit a nation’s capacity to manufacture gas would be harmful to the nation’s peaceful chemical industry because “[poisonous agents] play a… part in the development of insecticides,… disinfectants and medicinals” (451). He also says that such a treaty would be unenforceable because “any nation with a well-developed chemical industry possesses… the means to manufacture chemical warfare agents” (451) and could do so before regulators had a chance to react. Besides, he says, the only things really needed for the production of chemical weapons are “table salt, water, coal, sulphur, starch or sugar… lime, phosphate rock, arscenic… and bauxite…” (449) which are used in unrelated industries. Mills is effective in his argument but because his work is dated, it’s most useful for research on the attitudes of the era and not on for a history of policy.

Tucker, Jonathan B. War of Nerves: Chemical Warfare from World War I to Al 	Qaeda. New York: Pantheon, 2006. Print.

Johnathan B. Tucker was an Arms Control Specialist for the US State Department. Tucker earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Biology from Yale and a Ph. D in political science, focusing on defense and arms control, from MIT. Tucker also served as a UN Biological Weapons inspector in Iraq in 1995. In Tucker’s book, A War of Nerves, Tucker examines the use of chemical arms throughout their history. Tucker asserts that more needs to be done in regard to chemical weapons, saying “strengthening the legal… barriers against [their use] will be vital for human well-being… in the twenty-first century.” He starts by providing historical examples of their use and explains that in World War I, “… the traditional legal and moral restraints on the use of poison gas began to erode under the pressure of military necessity.” Then he goes on to describe their increasingly destructive power, culminating in the development of A-232 which “… turned out to be five to eight times more lethal than VX,” the most potent toxin ever used. Finally, Tucker also explains how easy it is for terrorist organizations to obtain chemical weapons by using “…front companies, transshipment points, falsified end-use certificates and other forms of deceptions [to obtain a chemical arsenal].” Tucker is clear and develops his arguments without assuming the reader has any prior knowledge.

Brown, Frederic Joseph. Chemical Warfare; a Study in Restraints. Princeton, NJ: 	Princeton UP, 1968. Print.

Lt. General Brown served in the US Military for 32 years, during which time he earned a PhD in Social Sciences from the Graduate Institute in Geneva, Switzerland. He also served in the White House as interim Deputy Chief of Staff for the President. In Brown’s book, Chemical Warfare, A Study in Restraints, Brown examines the restraints the either stopped or failed to stop chemical warfare during World War I and World War II. Brown says that current restraints are enough to stop larger nations from using chemical weaponry but that “[Weapons of Mass Destruction] will be employed in conflicts between… less-developed… nations, unless there is an immediate and effective non-proliferation treaty” (316). Brown provides historical evidence that traditional restraints failed, saying “overestimation of the influence of public opinion was a serious fallacy in interwar prognostication” (291). Brown explains that the only serious obstacle to their use was acceptance by the military because, “…the military establishment as a whole was opposed to their use… [Chemical Weapons] did not accord with the honor of the profession” (294). Brown also proves that treaties restricting their use but not providing for their destruction are meaningless, saying “the totality of the end… in the event of defeat, justified means of total defense…” (301). Brown is very detailed but his study is somewhat limited in scope because he does not include evidence from later eras, which somewhat reduces its effectiveness.

Hoeber, Amoretta M., and Joseph D. Douglass. "The Neglected Threat of Chemical 	Warfare." The MIT Press 3.1 (1978): 55-82. JSTOR. Web. 16 Nov. 2014.
Amoretta Hoeber is a military contractor during who specializes in weapons of mass destruction. She has also spoken before congress, arguing against the ratification of the CWC Treaty in 1996. Joseph Douglass was a noted authority on US – Soviet relations and WMDs. In their article, “The Neglected Threat of Chemical Warfare,” Douglass and Hoeber focus on US military readiness for Chemical Warfare. In it they argue that “… the United States should not curtail CW activities out of a ‘spirit of the negotiations’” (81). Douglass and Hoeber argue that military readiness for a chemical warfare is important because “… changes in other aspects of the overall military balance [of the world]… have made the CW situation more important” (78). They also argue that NATO has not paid enough attention to this threat, saying “…Soviet superiority over the United States [is serious] and continues to grow” (66). They also claim that the Soviet Union, would pursue a first use policy in the event of war because “… the repugnance [for chemical warfare] is not shared by the Soviet Union” (75). While Douglass and Hoeber accurately portrayal of NATO’s military readiness, they resort to alarmism to convince the reader of their thesis, especially when discussing Soviet offensive capabilities. They claim that the Soviets were ready to pursue a first-strike policy but only had access to information regarding Soviet defensive measures at the time and thus could not prove their claim conclusively.

Harris, Elisa D. "Stemming the Spread of Chemical Weapons." The Brookings Review 	8.1 (1990): 39-45. JSTOR. Web. 15 Nov. 2014. 

Elisa Harris is the Senior Research Scholar for the University of Maryland’s Center for International Security Studies. She has testified before congress on matter pertaining to chemical and biological weaponry. She received a Bachelor’s degree in government from the University of Georgetown and a M.Phil in international relations from the University of Oxford. In her article, Harris examines the possibility of a treaty that would be effective for stemming the spread of chemical weaponry. Harris asserts that “a treaty banning the development, production, possession, transfer and use of chemical weapons remains the best… way to stop [their] proliferation” (44). Harris says that such a ban would “enhance ongoing efforts to prevent developing countries from acquiring precursor chemicals and technical assistance” (44). Harris also says such a ban would “…provide legal basis for action against countries with chemical weapons” and would “enhance the prospects that action will be taken against countries that use chemical weapons” (45). Harris also says that “… a ban would prevent the many countries that are capable of making chemical weapons, but that have not yet done so, from taking this step” (45). Harris uses clear language that make her work accessible to any reader. She also summarizes the geopolitical climate at the end of the cold war into one cohesive set of issues useful to anyone interested in Chemical Weapons policy.

Chemical Weapons Convention
I chose the chemical weapons convention as a primary source for this research paper because it summarizes all previous efforts to ban and limit the use of chemical weaponry into a single global policy. It is the product of years of hard work from diplomats and all nations with an interest in preventing the spread of chemical weapons and currently has 165 signatories with more expected to follow in later years.
The Chemical Weapons Convention also marks the end of the last major chemical weapons arms race, which was between the Warsaw Pact and NATO during the Cold War. It marked a turning point in the history of Weapons of Mass Destruction and also replaced the long outdated articles of the Geneva Convention in preventing chemical warfare.

The likelihood that chemical warfare will break out has lowered in recent years due to the Chemical Weapons Convention and increasing calls for disarmament. However, the CWC has not been ratified by several industrialized nations; some of which, like North Korea, have the infrastructure to produce many tons of dangerous agents. It has also become apparent that some members of the CWC, Israel in particular, have pursued chemical weapons programs despite being signatories of a treaty banning their use. The CWC also makes efforts to address the proliferation of chemical weapons to terrorist groups but, as the terrorist attacks on the Tokyo subway system prove, more work needs to be done to prevent chemical arms from proliferating. This research has revealed three very important facts. Firstly, chemical weaponry has evolved to be extremely toxic and to defeat traditional detection and protective measures. Secondly, international policy has continuously lagged behind the threat of chemical weapons, which has allowed rogue states to acquire them. Finally, while most states are signatories of the chemical weapons convention, several important states have not taken signed it, including Egypt and North Korea, both of which have questionable records when it comes to weapons of mass destruction.
